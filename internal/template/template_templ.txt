<p class=\"text-sm\">Old School RuneScape is a popular MMORPG that has been around since 2013. If you ended up here because you play the game and want to build bots, you can skip to the next section.</p><p class=\"text-sm\">If you are here because you want to learn more about GUI automation, you can sign-up for an account <a class=\"text-blue-800 underline\" href=\"{ templ.SafeURL(&#34;https://oldschool.runescape.com/&#34;) }\">here</a> and follow along.</p>
 
<p class=\"text-sm\">This guide is not an introuduction to programming, and assumes you have a basic understanding of python and programming principles.</p><p class=\"text-sm\">However, if you are a novice programmer, this guide will definitely help you to learn more about programming skills, specifically problem solving. A lot of the challenges we face in building bots will have novel solutions, and will expose you to new ways of thinking about general programming problems.</p><p class=\"text-sm\">To get the most out of this guide, you will need a solid grasp of the following concepts:</p><ul class=\"text-sm grid\"><li>- terminal commands</li><li>- virtual environments</li><li>- pip and package management</li><li>- loops, conditionals, functions, and lists</li></ul><p class=\"text-sm\">If you are new to programming, I would recommend starting with <a class=\"text-blue-800 underline\" href=\"{ templ.SafeURL(&#34;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3&#34;) }\">Codecademy's Python 3 course</a>. It will teach you everything you need to get going and follow along with this guide.</p><p class=\"text-sm\">Now that we have that out of the way, let's get started!</p>
