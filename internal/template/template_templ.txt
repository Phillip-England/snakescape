<p>Old School RuneScape is a popular MMORPG that has been around since 2013. If you ended up here because you play the game and want to build bots, you can skip to the next section.</p><p>If you are here because you want to learn more about GUI automation, you can sign-up for an account <a class=\"text-blue underline\" href=\"

<p>This guide is not an introuduction to programming, and assumes you have a basic understanding of python and programming principles.</p><p>However, if you are a novice programmer, this guide will definitely help you to learn more about programming skills, specifically problem solving. A lot of the challenges we face in building bots will have novel solutions, and will expose you to new ways of thinking about general programming problems.</p><p>To get the most out of this guide, you will need a solid grasp of the following concepts:</p><ul class=\"grid\"><li>- terminal commands</li><li>- virtual environments</li><li>- pip and package management</li><li>- loops, conditionals, functions, and lists</li></ul><p>If you are new to programming, I would recommend starting with <a class=\"text-blue underline\" href=\"
